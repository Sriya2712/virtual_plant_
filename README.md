# virtual_plant_
The Virtual Plant project is a Python application using Tkinter that simulates plant growth. Users can water or fertilize the plant, making it advance through stages from seedling to tree. Growth progress is saved in a JSON file, ensuring continuity even after closing and reopening the program.
